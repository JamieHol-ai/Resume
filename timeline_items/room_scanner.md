My entry for the Gold Crest Award. The aim of this project was to design and build an affordable 3D room scanner capable of scanning spaces within a 180-degree field of view. Feel free to visit the [respository](https://github.com/JamieHol-ai/3D-Room-Scanner/blob/main/) to see the code and the report.
