I am enjoying working as part of a small team improving the localisation and mapping aspect for designing a self-driving Formula 1 race car, advancing my communication skills such as coordinating efforts and sharing ideas. I have been utilising SLAM algorithms, integrating various sensors, working with both Python and C++, which has helped me to improve my technical skills in these areas, as well as expanding my experience of using different tools and platforms. Our team peer reviews work, which has given me experience of giving and receiving constructive feedback and learning from my peers.
